          Project Goals:
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Build a functional Ruby command line app with SQLite3 integration.
          </li>
          <li>
            Get kicked in the teeth by rake/rspec until I learn what NOT to do.
          </li>
          <li>
            Familarize myself with Ruby and simple SQL database structure, customization, and functionality.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prepare myself for working inside of the Rails framework using the Ruby language.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
          Lessons learned:
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
          Embrace the BDD and TDD software development process in order to build software that is durable.
          </li>
          <li>
          Scale back scope! What do I mean? You MUST build a skill set around your ability to comfortably fit the scope of a project inside a deadline.
          </li>
          <li>
          Discovered how to tie user inputs into a SQL database and allow the user to retrieve that information accurately and as needed.
          </li>
          <li>
          Time is a priceless resource. It should be treated as such in the context of the software development process. Manage it properly or prepare to be destroyed.
          </li>
        </ul>
